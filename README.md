Long story

This is a quick remake of a very old application I built several years ago. The original intent was mainly for testing out app
Android app submission process and AdMob.

Since Google Play Store does not permit application deletion. I decided to strip out any third party content such as AdMob. I was unable to rebuild
the original sources. I ended up remaking the app from scratch.

A collection of signs in one application, easy to use. Now you can alert everybody about
any potential hazard, obstacle or condition requiring special attention.

NOTE: This application is a **JOKE** and should be used as such. Please do not use it for anything serious.

The Signs are classified as:
- Traffic - signs used to provide information to road users,
- Hazard - designed to warn about hazardous materials or locations,
- Prohibition - used to indicate when something is not permitted,
- Funny - other signs designed for your amusement.

Thank you for using the Pocket Signs application.
